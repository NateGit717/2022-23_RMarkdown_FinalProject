# RMarkdown_Final
This repository contains a final assignment for a course on predictive modeling (DSCI 412) that I took through Maryville University in Fall 2022. The idea was to showcase most, if not all, of the skills and tools that I gained over the course of the class in this assignment.

### Preliminary Information
This script utilizes RMarkdown witch takes an R script and outputs a notebook as an html or pdf file. This particular script will generate an html.
